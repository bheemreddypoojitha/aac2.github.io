  <h1>Lunar Life</h1>
  <h2 class="animate-text"></h2>
  <p class="animate-text"> The best place to look for life in the Solar System might not be nearby planets, like Mars, but on the distant moons Europa (which orbits Jupiter) and Enceladus (a satellite of Saturn). Both harbour a liquid water ocean underneath a thick icy crust.

It’s thought there must be an internal heat source preventing the moons’ oceans from freezing. Heat might be generated at the centre of each moon and released through hydrothermal vents on the ocean floors. On Earth, hydrothermal vents generate a chemical reaction that produces food for busy aquatic ecosystems.

  <h1>Alien Census</h1>
  <p class="animate-text">In 1848, the Scottish church minister and science teacher, Thomas Dick, set out to calculate the number of aliens living inside the Solar System. He predicted that if the population density of outer space matched that of England, with 280 people per square mile, then the Solar System must contain 22 TRILLION inhabitants.

  <h1>Solar Sailing</h1>
  <h2 class="animate-text"></h2>
  <p class="animate-text">An ambitious private project to reach this star system, called Breakthrough Starshot, was launched in 2016. Funded by Russian “venture capitalist and physicist” Yuri Milner, the aim is to develop a proof-of-concept solar sail spacecraft, which would ride on the solar wind at 20 percent of the speed of light. If they succeed then a fleet of these tiny crafts would take 20 years to reach Proxima Centauri and four more years to send data back to Earth.

  <h1>Mighty Martians</h1>
  <p class="animate-text">Martians roaming the Red Planet would be taller, on average, than humans, concluded astronomer William Herschel in the 1870s. Using ever-more powerful telescopes, he’d carefully measured the size of Mars, along with the length of its seasons and days. The Red Planet is smaller than ours, therefore it has lower gravity, said Herschel, meaning that Martians would grow much taller.

  <h1>Signs of life</h1>
  <p class="animate-text"> How do you search for life? When studying exoplanets, astronomers look for gases they call “biosignatures” which are telltale signs of life. Methane is expelled by creatures on Earth, from termites to cows, but it’s also produced by volcanoes. So we aim to detect methane in combination with other gases, like oxygen and ozone, which is produced naturally in our atmosphere by the action of sunlight.</p>

  <h1>The Goldilocks Zone</h1>
  <p class="animate-text"> Where do we look? The best place to concentrate on, we think, is probably exoplanets that lie in the “habitable zone”. This is a position that’s not too close, or far away, from their host star, thus providing the perfect conditions for life to spring up. The closest exoplanet we’ve discovered is called Promixa Centuri B. It lies in the habitable zone around the nearest star to our Sun.</p>
